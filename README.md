# An HTML &amp; CSS website of a fictitious rock band
## Open index.html through GitHub pages to view.

1) This is the first time I COMPLETED a project.
2) It does not have a responsive design, though. Looks best on a 1366 x 768 px screen.
3) It is a two-page website.
4) Used very simple HTML, CSS code + Images from Google.
